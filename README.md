üêù Bee Swarm Game

This .NET project simulates a dynamic, adversarial bee swarm environment using the MonoGame framework. It emphasizes replayability, realism, and player immersion through evolving AI and interactive swarm behavior inspired by nature.

‚∏ª

üåê Overview
	‚Ä¢	Simulation Core: Competing bee swarms evolve and battle in a procedurally generated world.
	‚Ä¢	Game Modes:
	‚Ä¢	Single Player: Face intelligent swarms adapting to your tactics.
	‚Ä¢	Multiplayer (Local/Online): Compete PvP, each player managing unique swarm attributes.
	‚Ä¢	Swarm Composition: Units adapt roles (e.g., gatherer, defender, scout) dynamically based on real-time stimuli and hive needs.

‚∏ª

üß† Swarm Behavior
	‚Ä¢	Adversarial AI: Leverages pheromone-mimicry, ambush logic, and emergent rules.
	‚Ä¢	Resource Control: Nodes produce nectar/pollen, enabling evolution and expansion.
	‚Ä¢	Evolution System: Use resources to unlock abilities (stealth, group attack, hive enhancements).

‚∏ª

üåç Environment & Obstacles
	‚Ä¢	Procedurally generated maps with moving hazards and terrain variability.
	‚Ä¢	Realistic foraging zones and enemy hive behavior inspired by natural patterns.

üéÆ Interactive UI & Visualization Features (MonoGame)

üó∫ Visual Game UI Enhancements
	‚Ä¢	Minimap Overlay: Displays territory control, hive status, and swarm icons.
	‚Ä¢	Swarm Indicators: Live unit count, aggression level, resource collection meters.
	‚Ä¢	Pheromone Trail Visuals: Display real-time decision paths and AI movement flows.
	‚Ä¢	Dynamic Camera Modes: Zoom between macro (tactical) and micro (unit-focused) perspectives.
	‚Ä¢	Hover Tooltips: Unit role, stats, and current task displayed on cursor interaction.

üìä Real-Time Data Visualizer

Track the simulation‚Äôs heartbeat using these interactive elements:
	‚Ä¢	Population Metrics:
	‚Ä¢	Pie charts for swarm role distribution
	‚Ä¢	Bar graphs for per-unit type counts across swarms
	‚Ä¢	Resource Flow:
	‚Ä¢	Line graphs showing nectar/pollen accumulation over time
	‚Ä¢	Rate of resource conversion into upgrades and units
	‚Ä¢	Territory Control:
	‚Ä¢	Heatmaps indicating zone dominance and conflict areas
	‚Ä¢	Graphs showing time-based control shifts
	‚Ä¢	Performance Metrics:
	‚Ä¢	Swarm growth rates, unit mortality, average swarm distance from hive
	‚Ä¢	Toggle all visualizations with hotkeys or UI panel for cleaner gameplay when needed.

üõ† Development Guidelines

Future features must focus on:
	‚Ä¢	Enhanced immersion: Realistic movement, sounds, and visual feedback
	‚Ä¢	Replayability: Procedural elements, randomized swarm personalities
	‚Ä¢	Strategic Clarity: Clear info overlays and decision-making cues

Roadmap Suggestions:
	‚Ä¢	Seasonal changes and weather effects
	‚Ä¢	AI tuning sliders for difficulty customization
	‚Ä¢	Replay system with metrics timeline
	‚Ä¢	Fog-of-war and communication upgrades
	‚Ä¢	Cross-platform multiplayer leaderboard integration

üß≠ Developer Tasking Instructions (for Copilot Integration)

To implement the advanced gameplay and visualization features described above, follow this structured roadmap:
	1.	Visualization Framework Setup
	‚Ä¢	Integrate a compatible data visualization library (e.g., OxyPlot, LiveCharts).
	‚Ä¢	Create a DataVisualizerManager to handle rendering for pie charts, bar graphs, line charts, and heatmaps.
	2.	Swarm Simulation Metrics
	‚Ä¢	Extend swarm unit models to track:
	‚Ä¢	Role and status (active/idle)
	‚Ä¢	Nectar and pollen collected
	‚Ä¢	Continuously log and update swarm population and role distribution.
	3.	Resource & Territory Tracking
	‚Ä¢	Track:
	‚Ä¢	Resource collection per hive
	‚Ä¢	Conversion rates into upgrades/units
	‚Ä¢	Swarm presence in zones to generate heatmaps for control
	4.	UI Integration
	‚Ä¢	Add UI panels or hotkey toggles for visualizations.
	‚Ä¢	Overlay components:
	‚Ä¢	Role pie charts
	‚Ä¢	Resource graphs
	‚Ä¢	Heatmaps
	‚Ä¢	Swarm growth rates and mortality
	5.	Event Trigger System
	‚Ä¢	Use event listeners for:
	‚Ä¢	Unit role changes
	‚Ä¢	Hive status updates
	‚Ä¢	Combat engagements
	6.	Performance Considerations
	‚Ä¢	Enable toggling of visual elements for cleaner gameplay.
	‚Ä¢	Profile impact and optimize rendering.
	7.	Bonus Features
	‚Ä¢	Add multiplayer metrics overlays.
	‚Ä¢	Support animated graph transitions.
	‚Ä¢	Prepare for serialization of simulation history.

üí° Tip for Copilot: Implement each metric visualization in an isolated branch and validate independently before merging.
